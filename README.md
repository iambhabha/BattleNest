## ðŸ’¡ How Automation Works

- **Room Creation**  
  â†’ When a match is scheduled, a Firebase Cloud Function creates a virtual "room" entry and updates all participants in real time.

- **Auto Kick System**  
  â†’ Players not verifying before deadline or breaking rules are auto-removed using Firestore triggers.

- **Live Updates**  
  â†’ Firestore streams enable instant updates for players and hosts.
